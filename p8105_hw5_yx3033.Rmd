## Problem 1

```{r}
birthday = function(n){
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
}
```

```{r}
sim_groupsize_df = 
  expand_grid(
    group_size = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  )
```

```{r}
sim_groupsize_df  = 
  sim_groupsize_df |> 
  mutate(
    matched = map_lgl(group_size, birthday)
  )
```

```{r}
#summarize probabilities

prob_df = 
  sim_groupsize_df |> 
  group_by(group_size) |> 
  summarise(probability = mean(matched))
```

```{r}
ggplot(prob_df,
       aes(x = group_size, y = probability)
) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Shared Birthday vs Group Size",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability"
  )
```

The probability of two people share a birthday starts from 0 and increases nonlinearly with group size. It reaches 50% when there are around 23 people. As the group size goes beyond 40, the probability grows start to slow down as the line gets flatter.
